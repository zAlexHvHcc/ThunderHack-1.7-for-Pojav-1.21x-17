ThunderHack 1.7 for Zalith Launcher / Pojav Glow 1.21x: (1.7)

This version is not just an update; it was made from the comfort of my bed. Changes include:

Shaders disabled in the main menu for better performance.

Discord RPC disabled.

Optimized for Zalith Launcher and Pojav Glow.

ClickGUI activated with the "P" key.

Prefix "@".

Compatible with Fabric 1.21/1.21.1.


‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

Honestly, making this compatible with PojavLauncher is much harder. PojavLauncher is falling behind‚Äîthe real leaders are Zalith Launcher and Pojav Glow.

If you want to use ThunderHack 1.7, you must install one of these:
