### üö® This version is not just an update; it was made from the comfort of my bed. üö®
**Changes include:**
- **Shaders** disabled in the main menu for better performance.
- **Discord RPC** disabled.
- Optimized for **Zalith Launcher** and **Pojav Glow**.
- **ClickGUI** activated with the **"P"** key.
- Prefix "**@**".
- Compatible with **Fabric 1.21/1.21.1**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
Honestly, making this compatible with PojavLauncher is much harder. **PojavLauncher** is falling behind‚Äîthe real leaders are **Zalith Launcher** and **Pojav Glow**.

---

### üîπ You must install one of these to use ThunderHack 1.7:
- **[Zalith Launcher Best](https://github.com/ZalithLauncher/ZalithLauncher)**
- **[Pojav Glow](https://github.com/Vera-Firefly/Pojav-Glow-Worm)**
